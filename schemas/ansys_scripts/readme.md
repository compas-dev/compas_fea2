ANSYS ADPL notes
================

Here are a few example of ADPL scripts for ansys. It's not the easiest language to read.

I have also created a markdown file where I explain a bit what is inside these script files. The
input file studied for this case is the cantilever beam with a surface load. I have either add
inline comments or comments before the code blocks.

I also join the documentation found on Ansys website. If you want to access these resources, create
